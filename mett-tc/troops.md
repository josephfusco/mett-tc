The platoon leader’s analysis of troops available for an operation includes an assessment of the platoon’s vehicles and equipment. Considerations in the analysis include the following:

+ What is the present condition of the platoon’s soldiers, vehicles, and equipment?
+ What is the supply status of ammunition, fuel, and other necessary items?
+ What is the state of training of the platoon?
+ What is the state of morale?
+ How much sleep have the men had?
+ How much sleep can they get before and during the operation?
+ Does the platoon need any additional equipment to support or accomplish its mission?
+ What attachments does the platoon have (or require) to accomplish its mission?
+ How many OPs (mounted/dismounted) can be manned with the available assets?
+ How big a frontage can be covered with the available assets?
