title: Civilian Considerations
---

In his analysis of how the platoon will handle situations involving civilians (including stability and support operations), the platoon leader should assess the following considerations:

+ What are the applicable rules of engagement (ROE) and/or rules of interaction (ROI)?
+ What procedures and guidelines will the platoon use in dealing with refugees, prisoners, and other civilians?
+ Will the platoon be working with civilian organizations, such as governmental agencies, private groups, or the media?
+ Will the platoon be tasked to conduct stability operations (such as peace operations or noncombatant evacuation) or support operations (such as humanitarian or environmental assistance)?
