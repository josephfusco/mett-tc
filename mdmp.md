## Military Decision Making Process

<strong>MDMP</strong> can be both slow and burdensome at lower levels, where small (companies/batteries) units do not have the manpower nor expertise to dissect each layer of higher headquarters’ orders.  The MDMP is intended as a planning tool for the primary staff of battalion sized units and larger as opposed to the “Troop Leading Procedures”, which are used to guide units subordinate to battalions.

The basic steps in the MDMP are:

1. Receipt of Mission
2. Mission Analysis
3. Course of action (COA) Development
4. COA Analysis (aka Wargaming)
5. COA Comparison
6. COA Approval
7. Orders Production
